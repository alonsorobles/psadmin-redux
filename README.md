* Consider adding a library like "Reselect" to memoize function calls if we are implementing expensive mapStateToProp functions
* Look into redux-promise when it becomes more stable and look at redux-saga as well as an alternative to redux-thunk
* Testing actions may not be worth while since logic is very simple yielding low value tests.
* Consider looking into "Redux Test Recorder" to automate testing redux reducers
* Redux store tests are integration tests that test actions, selectors, and reducers
